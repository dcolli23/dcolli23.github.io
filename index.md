Hello, my name is Dylan Colli.
I am a second year Robotics Master's student at the University of Michigan advised by [Dmitry Berenson](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/) as part of the University of Michigan [ARM Lab](https://arm.eecs.umich.edu/).
During my time in the ARM Lab, I've focused on two main projects.
My research focus is primarily in tracking and learning the dynamics of deformable objects via a differentiable filtering approach.
Additionally, I lead the development of an agricultural robotics research framework for the lab's Boston Dynamics Spot robot, during which I have led a total of 6 engineering students.
This framework leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) towards generalization of the full robot stack, including perception, mapping, and navigation modules.
Prior to the University of Michigan, I worked as an algorithm engineer in the target tracking team at the autonomous vehicle company, [Arriver](http://www.qualcomm.com/products/automotive/overview).

I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Kentucky where I worked in the labs of [Peter Kekenes-Huskey](http://pkhlab.sites.luc.edu/people.html) and [Ken Campbell](http://medicine.uky.edu/users/kscamp3) where I focused on applications of computer vision and multi-scale modelling towards the advancement of heart disease research.

You can get to know my work through the (admittedly pretty outdated!) [Projects](pages/projects/projects.md) link where you can find some (hopefully) interesting visualizations of things I've workd on in the past, like the video below:
