Hello, my name is Dylan Colli.
I am a first year Robotics Master's student at the University of Michigan advised by [Dmitry Berenson](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/).
My research focus is primarily in robot perception towards applications in agricultural robotics.
Prior to the University of Michigan, I worked as an algorithm engineer in the target tracking team at the autonomous vehicle company, [Arriver](https://www.arriver.com/about-us).

I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Kentucky where I worked in the labs of [Peter Kekenes-Huskey](https://pkhlab.sites.luc.edu/people.html) and [Ken Campbell](https://medicine.uky.edu/users/kscamp3), focused on applications of computer vision and multi-scale modelling towards the advancement of heart disease research.

You can get to know my work through the [Projects](pages/projects/projects.md) link where you can find some (hopefully) interesting visualizations of things I've workd on in the past, like the video below:
