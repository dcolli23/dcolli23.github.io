Ingreedyents is my exploration into creating a C++ backend and GUI using Qt. Ingreedyents helps track recipe nutrition information by obtaining ingredient nutrition infromation through scanning of the ingredient's UPC and performing a REST API request from the [FoodData Central API](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html).
